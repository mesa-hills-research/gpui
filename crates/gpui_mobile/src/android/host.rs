//! Host-driven Android entry point: a plain Java `Activity` owns a `SurfaceView`,
//! and GPUI runs on a **process-lived** render thread of our own.
//!
//! # Why this exists next to [`super::jni`]
//!
//! The `android-activity` path in `jni.rs` spawns a fresh native thread per Activity
//! and blocks the Java `onDestroy` until that thread stops ([`notify_destroyed`]).
//! A recreated Activity therefore always runs on a *new* thread, while
//! `AndroidDispatcher::new()` captured `ALooper_forThread()` of the *old* one — so
//! GPUI's `App::new_app` trips `assert!(is_main_thread(), "must construct App on main
//! thread")` and the screen goes black with nothing but a log line.
//!
//! Here the render thread is created once and outlives every Activity. Surfaces are
//! handed in and taken back through [`surface_created`] / [`surface_destroyed`], which
//! is the same mechanism the background/foreground cycle already uses
//! (`AndroidWindow::term_window` keeps the renderer and its atlas alive, `init_window`
//! re-attaches a new surface to it).
//!
//! This module is **additive**: the `android-activity` path is untouched, so both
//! entry points can coexist while hosts migrate.
//!
//! # What the host has to do
//!
//! From the Java UI thread, in this order:
//!
//! 1. In `Activity.onCreate` — every time, recreation included — call
//!    [`super::jni::set_host_activity`] from a JNI entry point, then [`start`] (a no-op
//!    after the first call).
//! 2. From `SurfaceHolder.Callback`: [`surface_created`] in both `surfaceCreated` and
//!    `surfaceChanged`, [`surface_destroyed`] in `surfaceDestroyed`.
//! 3. From `onResume` / `onPause`: [`resumed`] / [`paused`].
//! 4. From `onTouchEvent`, `dispatchKeyEvent` and the `InputConnection`:
//!    [`motion_event`], [`key`], [`ime_event`].
//!
//! The Activity must also expose the Java methods `jni.rs` calls back into for the IME
//! (`gpuiShowKeyboard`, `gpuiHideKeyboard`, `gpuiResetComposition`); `GpuiInputActivity`
//! in the example project is the reference implementation.
//!
//! # Threading contract
//!
//! - `render thread` — owns the `ALooper`, the `AndroidPlatform`, GPUI's `App` and the
//!   `ApplicationHandle` that keeps it alive. Everything GPUI touches stays here. It
//!   sleeps on the looper between commands and draws once per vsync that GPUI asked
//!   for (see [`super::frame_source`]).
//! - `Java UI thread` — calls the functions below. They only touch the command queue
//!   and a few atomics, never GPUI state.
//! - [`surface_destroyed`] **blocks** until the render thread has stopped using the
//!   surface. That wait is mandatory: destroying a `Surface` while a thread sits inside
//!   `ANativeWindow_lock` is a use-after-free.
